      <description>As I posted a blog Build a new blog for free with free SSL certificate., it is easy to build a blog site for free. But it has still disadvantage that need to know Git and markdown.
So you cannot chose this way to build it if you are building a blog site for non-engineer.
I&amp;rsquo;m sharing new method to build a CMS (Content Management System) for free with SSL/TLS connection within 30 mins.</description>

      <description>This blog was basically built with Github page, but it has some problems.
Despite you can build your static website in few minutes using Github page, it lacks functionality such as TSL/SSL communication and force SSL for that. I am using netlify instead to solve those problems.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how you build free SSL blog here.
What you will use are:
- Hugo
- Github
- Netlify</description>
